# Brightbox Cloud driver for Docker Machine

![](/docs/img/logo.png)

Install this driver in your PATH and you can create docker hosts with ease on [Brightbox Cloud](https://www.brightbox.com).

If you are new to Brightbox Cloud you can [sign up in 2 minutes](https://manage.brightbox.com/signup) and get your user credentials. You'll get a Â£20 credit to get you started creating docker hosts. 

## Installation

### From a Release

Official release versions of the driver include a binary for Linux, MacOS and
Windows. You can find them on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/brightbox/docker-machine-driver-brightbox/releases).

Pick the binary you require, download it into a directory on your
PATH as a file called `docker-machine-driver-brightbox` and make it
executable. For example to download the linux version run

```
curl -L -o ~/bin/docker-machine-driver-brightbox \
https://github.com/brightbox/docker-machine-driver-brightbox/releases/download/v0.0.1/bin.docker-machine-driver-brightbox_linux-amd64 && \
chmod 755 ~/bin/docker-machine-driver-brightbox

```

### From Source

To build and install, first clone this repo onto a server running Docker, then run:

```
$ make containerbuild && sudo make install
```

which will install the driver into `/usr/local/bin`

## Using the driver

To use the driver first make sure you are running at least [version 0.5.0 of `docker-machine`](https://github.com/docker/machine/releases).

```
$ docker-machine -v
Docker Machine Version: 0.5.0-rc4 (721f39d)
docker-machine version 0.5.0-rc4 (721f39d)
```

Check that `docker-machine` can see the Brightbox driver by asking for
the driver help.

```
$ docker-machine create -d brightbox | more
Usage: docker-machine create [OPTIONS] [arg...]

Create a machine.

Specify a driver with --driver to include the create flags for that driver in the help text.

Options:

   --brightbox-account 								Brightbox Cloud Account to operate on [$BRIGHTBOX_ACCOUNT]
   --brightbox-api-url "https://api.gb1.brightbox.com/"				Brightbox Cloud Api URL for selected Region [$BRIGHTBOX_API_URL]
...
```

To create a machine you'll need your user credentials.

If you are
[collaborating](https://www.brightbox.com/docs/reference/collaboration/) with
other Brightbox users make sure you specify the identifier of the account you
want to work with.

Then creating a docker host is as simple as

```
$ docker-machine create -d brightbox --brightbox-user-name frances@example.com \
--brightbox-password SecretPassword example
Running pre-create checks...

Provisioning created instance...

Copying certs to the remote machine...
Setting Docker configuration on the remote daemon...
To see how to connect Docker to this machine, run: docker-machine env example
```

or if you don't want your password stored or displayed anywhere

```
$ read -s -p "Enter password: " BRIGHTBOX_PASSWORD && \
docker-machine create -d brightbox \
--brightbox-user-name frances@example.com example
```

This creates a small server in the default [server
group](https://www.brightbox.com/docs/guides/cli/server-groups/)
for the account, and accesses the server over IPv6. If you are
running `docker-machine` on another server on the Brightbox Cloud
then this will work straight away. However if `docker-machine`
is installed elsewhere you'll need to [alter your firewall
policy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3eYMV_hbDk&hd=1) first to
include an appropriate inbound rule into the Docker access port which
runs over TCP on port 2376. Make sure this rule is tight as there is no
authentication on the docker port.

## Changing the settings

The driver has several options that you can use to get precisely the
docker host you want. You can see them all in the help list by running
`docker-machine create -d brightbox | more`

Here are the most useful options:

*   `--brightbox-type`

    By default `docker-machine` creates a small 1gb SSD server as the
    docker host. If you want a larger one, check the [server sizing
    page](https://www.brightbox.com/pricing/#full-pricing-table) for
    the available sizes, and then specify the memory size plus either
    `.ssd` or `.ssd-high-io` (for the larger disk version). So if you
    want a 4GB server just use `4gb.ssd` for this option.
    
    For more details on the available ids and handles [use the
    CLI](https://www.brightbox.com/docs/guides/cli/installation/)
    `brightbox types` command

*   `--brightbox-image`

    You can select the image you want to use for the docker host by
    specifiying the `img-xxxxx` id of the image you require. Docker requires
    a 64-bit operating system. You can get the image id from the Image
    Library in [Brightbox Manager](https://manage.brightbox.com) or [via
    the CLI](https://www.brightbox.com/docs/guides/cli/image-library/).

*   `--brightbox-group`

    You can add [server groups, and therefore firewall
    policies](https://www.brightbox.com/docs/guides/cli/firewall/)
    using the `--brightbox-group` option. Remember firewall policies
    are cumulative on the Brightbox Cloud and specifying groups
    replaces the default option of putting the server in the default
    group.

*   `--brightbox-zone`

    Every
    [Region](https://www.brightbox.com/docs/reference/glossary/#region)
    on the Brightbox Cloud has [multiple availability
    zones](https://www.brightbox.com/docs/reference/glossary/#zone)
    within it. Normally the default auto-allocation does the right thing
    but if you want specific placement specify the zone id or handle
    with this option.

    For more details on the available ids and handles [use the
    CLI](https://www.brightbox.com/docs/guides/cli/installation/)
    `brightbox zones` command

*   `--brightbox-ipv4`

    This is a flag that makes `docker-machine` access the server over
    IPv4 rather than IPv6. Brightbox servers run on a private IPv4
    network by default, so this will stop access to the server from
    outside the cloud unless you map a CloudIP to the server in
    [Brightbox Manager](https://manage.brightbox.com) or [via the
    CLI](https://www.brightbox.com/docs/guides/cli/cloud-ips/).
